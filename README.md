# 100DaysOfCode
Becase... why not?

## Why Python?
I love IT. I've been in the IT industry since 2011 but never in something as huge as cloud computing. Python is well welcomed in this domain. I hope, by the end of this 100 days of code challenge, this career path can jump start a positve change in my life.

#### The Challenge
I am committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

I will be coding for at least 1 hour a day. I will follow the 100 Days of Python from Angela YU on Udemy and the Python documentation as well as the documentation from MDN for JavaScript.

I prefer learning from a book. But I've taken other Angela Yu's courses: The Web Development Bootcamp and the Flutter Development Bootcamp, and she's a great teacher. But if you look at the curriculum from the 100 Days of Python, it is a little bit different; especially in the last couple of days.

[The Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) website is like a book. As such, it has thorough explanation on how the code works inside-out through a large number of tutorials. You might be wondering: but German, why don't you do one thing first and then the other when you're done?

Glad you ask that.

I'll be doing the Python Documentation so I can make it a hobby to always visit the docs when my code is not running well.

## Wish me luck!
