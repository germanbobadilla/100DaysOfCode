# What I learned this day:

1. Random module
2. random.choice()

I didn't do much this day. I wanted to create a rock, paper, scissors game and it took me more than two hours to complete.

I used the random module, but the logic of the game, although it worked, was innefficient.

I'll head of the video tomorrow and will try to learn more, so I can accomplish this game myself without watching the answer.
